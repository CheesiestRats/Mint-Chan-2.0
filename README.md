# Welcome to Mint-Chan 2.0


## F.A.Q:
### Ohhhhhh YEAH this is it baby, Mint-Chan 2.0
  You thought that the original Mint-Chan was wild? Well get ready for some REAL shidd. *Slaps top of discord bot* This baby can hold so much fucking code in it, programmed entirely in python, this bad boy literally simulates a user accessing their LLM through a chrome browser.
### Ok but *why*?
  Well, because the [Oobabooga Webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) has literally the most ASS api known to man, and until someone there fixes it, this really is the next best thing. There quite frank is nothing that this bot can't do now that its effectively simulating a real person typing away at the LLM chat box.

### So what *can* it do rat-man?
 haha welll......
 - It can have **PERSONALITY**, thats right, you heard it here first, no longer will it be a stubborn bastard that only spits out garbage responses, it knows things now, its actually **BIG BRAIN**.
 - It can connect to different API's easier, given that I've programmed the whole thing in Python now instead of basically stealing [Desinc's Sally Bot](https://github.com/CheesiestRats/SallyBot), there is literally endless possibilities for connecting your application to any service that has a python module.
 -  It can also dynamically interact with elements in the HTML page that is the Gradio WebUI which also means that it has all the fine control a standard user has.
